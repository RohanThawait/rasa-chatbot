responses:
  utter_stressed_sarah_ack: 
  - text: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of stress. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on at work?

  utter_CBT_permission:
  - text: I understand. That sounds like a very demanding situation.  There are some techniques from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) that might help you manage your stress.  Would you be interested in learning some?

  utter_challenging_negative_thought:
  - text: Great! One technique involves identifying negative thought patterns that might be contributing to your stress.  Can you tell me a specific thought that's been bothering you lately?

  utter_explore_thought:
  - text: Okay, that's a very common fear.  Let's explore this thought a bit.  Is there any evidence to support this idea that you're definitely going to mess up?

  utter_bot_challenge_sarah_thought:
  - text: Exactly. It seems like this might be a bit of an unhelpful thought pattern.  Perhaps a more balanced thought could be "This is a challenging deadline, but I'm capable of handling it.  I'll take things one step at a time and ask for help if I need it."  What do you think about that?

  utter_final_sarah_feeling:
  - text:  How do you feel after that exercise?
