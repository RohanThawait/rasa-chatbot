Hold it for a moment, then exhale slowly through your mouth, counting to six. Let's do that a few more times together.

  utter_glad_to_hear:
  - text:  I'm glad to hear that! Incorporating relaxation techniques like this into your bedtime routine can help signal to your body that it's time to unwind and prepare for sleep.

  utter_asked_for_help:

Would you be open to exploring these options?
